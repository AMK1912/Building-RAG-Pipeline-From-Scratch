Each provider \\nhas larger models, which are more expensive, accu- \\nrate, and slower, and smaller models, which are \\nfaster, cheaper, and less accurate .\\nWe typically recommend that people start with \\nmore expensive models when prototyping — once \\nyou get something working, you can tweak cost .\\nContext window size \\nOne variable you may want to think about is the \\n“context window” of your model. How many tokens \\ncan it take? Sometimes, especially for early prototyp- \\ning, you may want to feed huge amounts of context \\ninto a model to save the e ﬀort of selecting the rele- \\nvant context .\\nRight now , the longest context windows belong \\nto the Google Gemini Flash set of models; Gemini \\nFlash 1.5 Pro supports a 2 million token context \\nwindow (roughly 4,000 pages of text ). \\nThis allows some interesting applications; you',\n",
